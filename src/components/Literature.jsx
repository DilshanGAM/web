            The evolution of microservice-based architectures (MSA) has brought increased flexibility and scalability to modern software systems. However, it has also introduced new challenges in managing system complexity, maintainability, and service-level agreements. Architectural smells such as cyclic dependencies, tightly coupled services, and improper service granularity are often hard to detect and can degrade system performance and maintainability over time [1].

            Various studies have proposed the use of runtime monitoring, coupling/cohesion metrics, and graph-based modeling to capture and analyze service dependencies [2]. Yet, real-time observability and actionable insights for large-scale MSA systems remain a concern due to high system dynamism and distributed nature [3]. This motivates the development of tools like MentCare that combine dynamic monitoring, graph analytics, and anomaly detection to support better architectural decision-making and long-term maintainability.
